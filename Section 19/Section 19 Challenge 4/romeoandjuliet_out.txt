1    ACT I
2    PROLOGUE
3    Two households, both alike in dignity,
4    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
5    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
6    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
7    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
8    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
9    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
10   Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
11   The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
12   And the continuance of their parents' rage,
13   Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
14   Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
15   The which if you with patient ears attend,
16   What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
17   SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
18   Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
19   SAMPSON
20   Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
21   GREGORY
22   No, for then we should be colliers.
23   SAMPSON
24   I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
25   GREGORY
26   Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
27   SAMPSON
28   I strike quickly, being moved.
29   GREGORY
30   But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
31   SAMPSON
32   A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
33   GREGORY
34   To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
35   therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
36   SAMPSON
37   A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
38   take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
39   GREGORY
40   That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
41   to the wall.
42   SAMPSON
43   True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
44   are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
45   Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
46   to the wall.
47   GREGORY
48   The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
49   SAMPSON
50   'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
51   have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
52   maids, and cut off their heads.
53   GREGORY
54   The heads of the maids?
55   SAMPSON
56   Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
57   take it in what sense thou wilt.
58   GREGORY
59   They must take it in sense that feel it.
60   SAMPSON
61   Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
62   'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
63   GREGORY
64   'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
65   hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
66   two of the house of the Montagues.
67   SAMPSON
68   My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
69   GREGORY
70   How! turn thy back and run?
71   SAMPSON
72   Fear me not.
73   GREGORY
74   No, marry; I fear thee!
75   SAMPSON
76   Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
77   GREGORY
78   I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
79   they list.
80   SAMPSON
81   Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
82   which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
83   Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
84   ABRAHAM
85   Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
86   SAMPSON
87   I do bite my thumb, sir.
88   ABRAHAM
89   Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
90   SAMPSON
91   [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
92   ay?
93   GREGORY
94   No.
95   SAMPSON
96   No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
97   bite my thumb, sir.
98   GREGORY
99   Do you quarrel, sir?
100  ABRAHAM
101  Quarrel sir! no, sir.
102  SAMPSON
103  If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
104  ABRAHAM
105  No better.
106  SAMPSON
107  Well, sir.
108  GREGORY
109  Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
110  SAMPSON
111  Yes, better, sir.
112  ABRAHAM
113  You lie.
114  SAMPSON
115  Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
116  They fight
117  Enter BENVOLIO
118  BENVOLIO
119  Part, fools!
120  Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
121  Beats down their swords
122  Enter TYBALT
123  TYBALT
124  What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
125  Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
126  BENVOLIO
127  I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
128  Or manage it to part these men with me.
129  TYBALT
130  What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
131  As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
132  Have at thee, coward!
133  They fight
134  Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs
135  First Citizen
136  Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
137  Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
138  Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET
139  CAPULET
140  What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
141  LADY CAPULET
142  A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
143  CAPULET
144  My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
145  And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
146  Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
147  MONTAGUE
148  Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
149  LADY MONTAGUE
150  Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
151  Enter PRINCE, with Attendants
152  PRINCE
153  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
154  Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
155  Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
156  That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
157  With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
158  On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
159  Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
160  And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
161  Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
162  By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
163  Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
164  And made Verona's ancient citizens
165  Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
166  To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
167  Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
168  If ever you disturb our streets again,
169  Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
170  For this time, all the rest depart away:
171  You Capulet; shall go along with me:
172  And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
173  To know our further pleasure in this case,
174  To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
175  Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
176  Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO
177  MONTAGUE
178  Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
179  Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
180  BENVOLIO
181  Here were the servants of your adversary,
182  And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
183  I drew to part them: in the instant came
184  The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
185  Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
186  He swung about his head and cut the winds,
187  Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
188  While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
189  Came more and more and fought on part and part,
190  Till the prince came, who parted either part.
191  LADY MONTAGUE
192  O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
193  Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
194  BENVOLIO
195  Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
196  Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
197  A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
198  Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
199  That westward rooteth from the city's side,
200  So early walking did I see your son:
201  Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
202  And stole into the covert of the wood:
203  I, measuring his affections by my own,
204  That most are busied when they're most alone,
205  Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
206  And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
207  MONTAGUE
208  Many a morning hath he there been seen,
209  With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
210  Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
211  But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
212  Should in the furthest east begin to draw
213  The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
214  Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
215  And private in his chamber pens himself,
216  Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
217  And makes himself an artificial night:
218  Black and portentous must this humour prove,
219  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
220  BENVOLIO
221  My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
222  MONTAGUE
223  I neither know it nor can learn of him.
224  BENVOLIO
225  Have you importuned him by any means?
226  MONTAGUE
227  Both by myself and many other friends:
228  But he, his own affections' counsellor,
229  Is to himself--I will not say how true--
230  But to himself so secret and so close,
231  So far from sounding and discovery,
232  As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
233  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
234  Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
235  Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
236  We would as willingly give cure as know.
237  Enter ROMEO
238  BENVOLIO
239  See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
240  I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
241  MONTAGUE
242  I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
243  To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
244  Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
245  BENVOLIO
246  Good-morrow, cousin.
247  ROMEO
248  Is the day so young?
249  BENVOLIO
250  But new struck nine.
251  ROMEO
252  Ay me! sad hours seem long.
253  Was that my father that went hence so fast?
254  BENVOLIO
255  It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
256  ROMEO
257  Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
258  BENVOLIO
259  In love?
260  ROMEO
261  Out--
262  BENVOLIO
263  Of love?
264  ROMEO
265  Out of her favour, where I am in love.
266  BENVOLIO
267  Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
268  Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
269  ROMEO
270  Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
271  Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
272  Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
273  Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
274  Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
275  Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
276  O any thing, of nothing first create!
277  O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
278  Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
279  Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
280  sick health!
281  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
282  This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
283  Dost thou not laugh?
284  BENVOLIO
285  No, coz, I rather weep.
286  ROMEO
287  Good heart, at what?
288  BENVOLIO
289  At thy good heart's oppression.
290  ROMEO
291  Why, such is love's transgression.
292  Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
293  Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
294  With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
295  Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
296  Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
297  Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
298  Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
299  What is it else? a madness most discreet,
300  A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
301  Farewell, my coz.
302  BENVOLIO
303  Soft! I will go along;
304  An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
305  ROMEO
306  Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
307  This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
308  BENVOLIO
309  Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
310  ROMEO
311  What, shall I groan and tell thee?
312  BENVOLIO
313  Groan! why, no.
314  But sadly tell me who.
315  ROMEO
316  Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
317  Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
318  In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
319  BENVOLIO
320  I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
321  ROMEO
322  A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
323  BENVOLIO
324  A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
325  ROMEO
326  Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
327  With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
328  And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
329  From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
330  She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
331  Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
332  Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
333  O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
334  That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
335  BENVOLIO
336  Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
337  ROMEO
338  She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
339  For beauty starved with her severity
340  Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
341  She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
342  To merit bliss by making me despair:
343  She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
344  Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
345  BENVOLIO
346  Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
347  ROMEO
348  O, teach me how I should forget to think.
349  BENVOLIO
350  By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
351  Examine other beauties.
352  ROMEO
353  'Tis the way
354  To call hers exquisite, in question more:
355  These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
356  Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
357  He that is strucken blind cannot forget
358  The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
359  Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
360  What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
361  Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
362  Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
363  BENVOLIO
364  I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
365  Exeunt
366  SCENE II. A street.
367  Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant
368  CAPULET
369  But Montague is bound as well as I,
370  In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
371  For men so old as we to keep the peace.
372  PARIS
373  Of honourable reckoning are you both;
374  And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
375  But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
376  CAPULET
377  But saying o'er what I have said before:
378  My child is yet a stranger in the world;
379  She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
380  Let two more summers wither in their pride,
381  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
382  PARIS
383  Younger than she are happy mothers made.
384  CAPULET
385  And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
386  The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
387  She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
388  But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
389  My will to her consent is but a part;
390  An she agree, within her scope of choice
391  Lies my consent and fair according voice.
392  This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
393  Whereto I have invited many a guest,
394  Such as I love; and you, among the store,
395  One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
396  At my poor house look to behold this night
397  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
398  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
399  When well-apparell'd April on the heel
400  Of limping winter treads, even such delight
401  Among fresh female buds shall you this night
402  Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
403  And like her most whose merit most shall be:
404  Which on more view, of many mine being one
405  May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
406  Come, go with me.
407  To Servant, giving a paper
408  Go, sirrah, trudge about
409  Through fair Verona; find those persons out
410  Whose names are written there, and to them say,
411  My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
412  Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
413  Servant
414  Find them out whose names are written here! It is
415  written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
416  yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
417  his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
418  sent to find those persons whose names are here
419  writ, and can never find what names the writing
420  person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
421  Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO
422  BENVOLIO
423  Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
424  One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
425  Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
426  One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
427  Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
428  And the rank poison of the old will die.
429  ROMEO
430  Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
431  BENVOLIO
432  For what, I pray thee?
433  ROMEO
434  For your broken shin.
435  BENVOLIO
436  Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
437  ROMEO
438  Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
439  Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
440  Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
441  Servant
442  God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
443  ROMEO
444  Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
445  Servant
446  Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
447  pray, can you read any thing you see?
448  ROMEO
449  Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
450  Servant
451  Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
452  ROMEO
453  Stay, fellow; I can read.
454  Reads
455  'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
456  County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
457  widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
458  nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
459  uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
460  Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
461  Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
462  assembly: whither should they come?
463  Servant
464  Up.
465  ROMEO
466  Whither?
467  Servant
468  To supper; to our house.
469  ROMEO
470  Whose house?
471  Servant
472  My master's.
473  ROMEO
474  Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
475  Servant
476  Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
477  great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
478  of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
479  Rest you merry!
480  Exit
481  BENVOLIO
482  At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
483  Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
484  With all the admired beauties of Verona:
485  Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
486  Compare her face with some that I shall show,
487  And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
488  ROMEO
489  When the devout religion of mine eye
490  Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
491  And these, who often drown'd could never die,
492  Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
493  One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
494  Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
495  BENVOLIO
496  Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
497  Herself poised with herself in either eye:
498  But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
499  Your lady's love against some other maid
500  That I will show you shining at this feast,
501  And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
502  ROMEO
503  I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
504  But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
505  Exeunt
506  SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.
507  Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
508  LADY CAPULET
509  Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
510  Nurse
511  Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
512  I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
513  God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
514  Enter JULIET
515  JULIET
516  How now! who calls?
517  Nurse
518  Your mother.
519  JULIET
520  Madam, I am here.
521  What is your will?
522  LADY CAPULET
523  This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
524  We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
525  I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
526  Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
527  Nurse
528  Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
529  LADY CAPULET
530  She's not fourteen.
531  Nurse
532  I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
533  And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
534  She is not fourteen. How long is it now
535  To Lammas-tide?
536  LADY CAPULET
537  A fortnight and odd days.
538  Nurse
539  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
540  Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
541  Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
542  Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
543  She was too good for me: but, as I said,
544  On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
545  That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
546  'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
547  And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
548  Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
549  For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
550  Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
551  My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
552  Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
553  When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
554  Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
555  To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
556  Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
557  To bid me trudge:
558  And since that time it is eleven years;
559  For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
560  She could have run and waddled all about;
561  For even the day before, she broke her brow:
562  And then my husband--God be with his soul!
563  A' was a merry man--took up the child:
564  'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
565  Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
566  Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
567  The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
568  To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
569  I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
570  I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
571  And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
572  LADY CAPULET
573  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
574  Nurse
575  Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
576  To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
577  And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
578  A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
579  A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
580  'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
581  Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
582  Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
583  JULIET
584  And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
585  Nurse
586  Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
587  Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
588  An I might live to see thee married once,
589  I have my wish.
590  LADY CAPULET
591  Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
592  I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
593  How stands your disposition to be married?
594  JULIET
595  It is an honour that I dream not of.
596  Nurse
597  An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
598  I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
599  LADY CAPULET
600  Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
601  Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
602  Are made already mothers: by my count,
603  I was your mother much upon these years
604  That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
605  The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
606  Nurse
607  A man, young lady! lady, such a man
608  As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
609  LADY CAPULET
610  Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
611  Nurse
612  Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
613  LADY CAPULET
614  What say you? can you love the gentleman?
615  This night you shall behold him at our feast;
616  Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
617  And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
618  Examine every married lineament,
619  And see how one another lends content
620  And what obscured in this fair volume lies
621  Find written in the margent of his eyes.
622  This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
623  To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
624  The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
625  For fair without the fair within to hide:
626  That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
627  That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
628  So shall you share all that he doth possess,
629  By having him, making yourself no less.
630  Nurse
631  No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
632  LADY CAPULET
633  Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
634  JULIET
635  I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
636  But no more deep will I endart mine eye
637  Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
638  Enter a Servant
639  Servant
640  Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
641  called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
642  the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
643  hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
644  LADY CAPULET
645  We follow thee.
646  Exit Servant
647  Juliet, the county stays.
648  Nurse
649  Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
650  Exeunt
651  SCENE IV. A street.
652  Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others
653  ROMEO
654  What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
655  Or shall we on without a apology?
656  BENVOLIO
657  The date is out of such prolixity:
658  We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
659  Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
660  Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
661  Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
662  After the prompter, for our entrance:
663  But let them measure us by what they will;
664  We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
665  ROMEO
666  Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
667  Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
668  MERCUTIO
669  Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
670  ROMEO
671  Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
672  With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
673  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
674  MERCUTIO
675  You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
676  And soar with them above a common bound.
677  ROMEO
678  I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
679  To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
680  I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
681  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
682  MERCUTIO
683  And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
684  Too great oppression for a tender thing.
685  ROMEO
686  Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
687  Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
688  MERCUTIO
689  If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
690  Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
691  Give me a case to put my visage in:
692  A visor for a visor! what care I
693  What curious eye doth quote deformities?
694  Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
695  BENVOLIO
696  Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
697  But every man betake him to his legs.
698  ROMEO
699  A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
700  Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
701  For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
702  I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
703  The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
704  MERCUTIO
705  Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
706  If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
707  Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
708  Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
709  ROMEO
710  Nay, that's not so.
711  MERCUTIO
712  I mean, sir, in delay
713  We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
714  Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
715  Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
716  ROMEO
717  And we mean well in going to this mask;
718  But 'tis no wit to go.
719  MERCUTIO
720  Why, may one ask?
721  ROMEO
722  I dream'd a dream to-night.
723  MERCUTIO
724  And so did I.
725  ROMEO
726  Well, what was yours?
727  MERCUTIO
728  That dreamers often lie.
729  ROMEO
730  In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
731  MERCUTIO
732  O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
733  She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
734  In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
735  On the fore-finger of an alderman,
736  Drawn with a team of little atomies
737  Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
738  Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
739  The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
740  The traces of the smallest spider's web,
741  The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
742  Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
743  Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
744  Not so big as a round little worm
745  Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
746  Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
747  Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
748  Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
749  And in this state she gallops night by night
750  Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
751  O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
752  O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
753  O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
754  Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
755  Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
756  Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
757  And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
758  And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
759  Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
760  Then dreams, he of another benefice:
761  Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
762  And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
763  Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
764  Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
765  Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
766  And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
767  And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
768  That plats the manes of horses in the night,
769  And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
770  Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
771  This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
772  That presses them and learns them first to bear,
773  Making them women of good carriage:
774  This is she--
775  ROMEO
776  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
777  Thou talk'st of nothing.
778  MERCUTIO
779  True, I talk of dreams,
780  Which are the children of an idle brain,
781  Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
782  Which is as thin of substance as the air
783  And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
784  Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
785  And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
786  Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
787  BENVOLIO
788  This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
789  Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
790  ROMEO
791  I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
792  Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
793  Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
794  With this night's revels and expire the term
795  Of a despised life closed in my breast
796  By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
797  But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
798  Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
799  BENVOLIO
800  Strike, drum.
801  Exeunt
802  SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
803  Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
804  First Servant
805  Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
806  shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
807  Second Servant
808  When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
809  hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
810  First Servant
811  Away with the joint-stools, remove the
812  court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
813  me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
814  the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
815  Antony, and Potpan!
816  Second Servant
817  Ay, boy, ready.
818  First Servant
819  You are looked for and called for, asked for and
820  sought for, in the great chamber.
821  Second Servant
822  We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
823  brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
824  Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers
825  CAPULET
826  Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
827  Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
828  Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
829  Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
830  She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
831  Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
832  That I have worn a visor and could tell
833  A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
834  Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
835  You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
836  A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
837  Music plays, and they dance
838  More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
839  And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
840  Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
841  Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
842  For you and I are past our dancing days:
843  How long is't now since last yourself and I
844  Were in a mask?
845  Second Capulet
846  By'r lady, thirty years.
847  CAPULET
848  What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
849  'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
850  Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
851  Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
852  Second Capulet
853  'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
854  His son is thirty.
855  CAPULET
856  Will you tell me that?
857  His son was but a ward two years ago.
858  ROMEO
859  [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
860  enrich the hand
861  Of yonder knight?
862  Servant
863  I know not, sir.
864  ROMEO
865  O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
866  It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
867  Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
868  Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
869  So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
870  As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
871  The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
872  And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
873  Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
874  For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
875  TYBALT
876  This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
877  Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
878  Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
879  To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
880  Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
881  To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
882  CAPULET
883  Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
884  TYBALT
885  Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
886  A villain that is hither come in spite,
887  To scorn at our solemnity this night.
888  CAPULET
889  Young Romeo is it?
890  TYBALT
891  'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
892  CAPULET
893  Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
894  He bears him like a portly gentleman;
895  And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
896  To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
897  I would not for the wealth of all the town
898  Here in my house do him disparagement:
899  Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
900  It is my will, the which if thou respect,
901  Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
902  And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
903  TYBALT
904  It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
905  I'll not endure him.
906  CAPULET
907  He shall be endured:
908  What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
909  Am I the master here, or you? go to.
910  You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
911  You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
912  You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
913  TYBALT
914  Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
915  CAPULET
916  Go to, go to;
917  You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
918  This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
919  You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
920  Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
921  Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
922  I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
923  TYBALT
924  Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
925  Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
926  I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
927  Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
928  Exit
929  ROMEO
930  [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
931  This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
932  My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
933  To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
934  JULIET
935  Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
936  Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
937  For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
938  And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
939  ROMEO
940  Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
941  JULIET
942  Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
943  ROMEO
944  O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
945  They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
946  JULIET
947  Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
948  ROMEO
949  Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
950  Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
951  JULIET
952  Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
953  ROMEO
954  Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
955  Give me my sin again.
956  JULIET
957  You kiss by the book.
958  Nurse
959  Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
960  ROMEO
961  What is her mother?
962  Nurse
963  Marry, bachelor,
964  Her mother is the lady of the house,
965  And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
966  I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
967  I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
968  Shall have the chinks.
969  ROMEO
970  Is she a Capulet?
971  O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
972  BENVOLIO
973  Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
974  ROMEO
975  Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
976  CAPULET
977  Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
978  We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
979  Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
980  I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
981  More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
982  Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
983  I'll to my rest.
984  Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
985  JULIET
986  Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
987  Nurse
988  The son and heir of old Tiberio.
989  JULIET
990  What's he that now is going out of door?
991  Nurse
992  Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
993  JULIET
994  What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
995  Nurse
996  I know not.
997  JULIET
998  Go ask his name: if he be married.
999  My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
1000 Nurse
1001 His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
1002 The only son of your great enemy.
1003 JULIET
1004 My only love sprung from my only hate!
1005 Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1006 Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
1007 That I must love a loathed enemy.
1008 Nurse
1009 What's this? what's this?
1010 JULIET
1011 A rhyme I learn'd even now
1012 Of one I danced withal.
1013 One calls within 'Juliet.'
1014 Nurse
1015 Anon, anon!
1016 Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

1019 PROLOGUE
1020 Enter Chorus
1021 Chorus
1022 Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
1023 And young affection gapes to be his heir;
1024 That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
1025 With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
1026 Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
1027 Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
1028 But to his foe supposed he must complain,
1029 And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
1030 Being held a foe, he may not have access
1031 To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
1032 And she as much in love, her means much less
1033 To meet her new-beloved any where:
1034 But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
1035 Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
1036 Exit
1037 SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
1038 Enter ROMEO
1039 ROMEO
1040 Can I go forward when my heart is here?
1041 Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
1042 He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it
1043 Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
1044 BENVOLIO
1045 Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
1046 MERCUTIO
1047 He is wise;
1048 And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
1049 BENVOLIO
1050 He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
1051 Call, good Mercutio.
1052 MERCUTIO
1053 Nay, I'll conjure too.
1054 Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
1055 Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
1056 Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
1057 Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
1058 Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
1059 One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
1060 Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
1061 When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
1062 He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
1063 The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
1064 I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
1065 By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
1066 By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
1067 And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
1068 That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
1069 BENVOLIO
1070 And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
1071 MERCUTIO
1072 This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
1073 To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
1074 Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
1075 Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
1076 That were some spite: my invocation
1077 Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
1078 I conjure only but to raise up him.
1079 BENVOLIO
1080 Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
1081 To be consorted with the humorous night:
1082 Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
1083 MERCUTIO
1084 If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
1085 Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
1086 And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
1087 As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
1088 Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
1089 An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
1090 Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
1091 This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
1092 Come, shall we go?
1093 BENVOLIO
1094 Go, then; for 'tis in vain
1095 To seek him here that means not to be found.
1096 Exeunt
1097 SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
1098 Enter ROMEO
1099 ROMEO
1100 He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
1101 JULIET appears above at a window
1102 But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
1103 It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
1104 Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
1105 Who is already sick and pale with grief,
1106 That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
1107 Be not her maid, since she is envious;
1108 Her vestal livery is but sick and green
1109 And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
1110 It is my lady, O, it is my love!
1111 O, that she knew she were!
1112 She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
1113 Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
1114 I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
1115 Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
1116 Having some business, do entreat her eyes
1117 To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1118 What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1119 The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
1120 As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
1121 Would through the airy region stream so bright
1122 That birds would sing and think it were not night.
1123 See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
1124 O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
1125 That I might touch that cheek!
1126 JULIET
1127 Ay me!
1128 ROMEO
1129 She speaks:
1130 O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
1131 As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
1132 As is a winged messenger of heaven
1133 Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
1134 Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1135 When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
1136 And sails upon the bosom of the air.
1137 JULIET
1138 O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
1139 Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
1140 Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1141 And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
1142 ROMEO
1143 [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
1144 JULIET
1145 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
1146 Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1147 What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
1148 Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
1149 Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
1150 What's in a name? that which we call a rose
1151 By any other name would smell as sweet;
1152 So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
1153 Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1154 Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
1155 And for that name which is no part of thee
1156 Take all myself.
1157 ROMEO
1158 I take thee at thy word:
1159 Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
1160 Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
1161 JULIET
1162 What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
1163 So stumblest on my counsel?
1164 ROMEO
1165 By a name
1166 I know not how to tell thee who I am:
1167 My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
1168 Because it is an enemy to thee;
1169 Had I it written, I would tear the word.
1170 JULIET
1171 My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
1172 Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
1173 Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
1174 ROMEO
1175 Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
1176 JULIET
1177 How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1178 The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
1179 And the place death, considering who thou art,
1180 If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
1181 ROMEO
1182 With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
1183 For stony limits cannot hold love out,
1184 And what love can do that dares love attempt;
1185 Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
1186 JULIET
1187 If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
1188 ROMEO
1189 Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1190 Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
1191 And I am proof against their enmity.
1192 JULIET
1193 I would not for the world they saw thee here.
1194 ROMEO
1195 I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
1196 And but thou love me, let them find me here:
1197 My life were better ended by their hate,
1198 Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
1199 JULIET
1200 By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
1201 ROMEO
1202 By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
1203 He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
1204 I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1205 As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
1206 I would adventure for such merchandise.
1207 JULIET
1208 Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
1209 Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1210 For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
1211 Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
1212 What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
1213 Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
1214 And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
1215 Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
1216 Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1217 If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
1218 Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
1219 I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
1220 So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
1221 In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1222 And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
1223 But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1224 Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
1225 I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1226 But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
1227 My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
1228 And not impute this yielding to light love,
1229 Which the dark night hath so discovered.
1230 ROMEO
1231 Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
1232 That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
1233 JULIET
1234 O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1235 That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1236 Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
1237 ROMEO
1238 What shall I swear by?
1239 JULIET
1240 Do not swear at all;
1241 Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1242 Which is the god of my idolatry,
1243 And I'll believe thee.
1244 ROMEO
1245 If my heart's dear love--
1246 JULIET
1247 Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1248 I have no joy of this contract to-night:
1249 It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
1250 Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1251 Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1252 This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1253 May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1254 Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
1255 Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
1256 ROMEO
1257 O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1258 JULIET
1259 What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
1260 ROMEO
1261 The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1262 JULIET
1263 I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
1264 And yet I would it were to give again.
1265 ROMEO
1266 Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
1267 JULIET
1268 But to be frank, and give it thee again.
1269 And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
1270 My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1271 My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
1272 The more I have, for both are infinite.
1273 Nurse calls within
1274 I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
1275 Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1276 Stay but a little, I will come again.
1277 Exit, above
1278 ROMEO
1279 O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
1280 Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1281 Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
1282 Re-enter JULIET, above
1283 JULIET
1284 Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1285 If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1286 Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1287 By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1288 Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1289 And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1290 And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
1291 Nurse
1292 [Within] Madam!
1293 JULIET
1294 I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
1295 I do beseech thee--
1296 Nurse
1297 [Within] Madam!
1298 JULIET
1299 By and by, I come:--
1300 To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
1301 To-morrow will I send.
1302 ROMEO
1303 So thrive my soul--
1304 JULIET
1305 A thousand times good night!
1306 Exit, above
1307 ROMEO
1308 A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
1309 Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
1310 their books,
1311 But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
1312 Retiring
1313 Re-enter JULIET, above
1314 JULIET
1315 Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
1316 To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1317 Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
1318 Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1319 And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
1320 With repetition of my Romeo's name.
1321 ROMEO
1322 It is my soul that calls upon my name:
1323 How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1324 Like softest music to attending ears!
1325 JULIET
1326 Romeo!
1327 ROMEO
1328 My dear?
1329 JULIET
1330 At what o'clock to-morrow
1331 Shall I send to thee?
1332 ROMEO
1333 At the hour of nine.
1334 JULIET
1335 I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1336 I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1337 ROMEO
1338 Let me stand here till thou remember it.
1339 JULIET
1340 I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1341 Remembering how I love thy company.
1342 ROMEO
1343 And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1344 Forgetting any other home but this.
1345 JULIET
1346 'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
1347 And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
1348 Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
1349 Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1350 And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
1351 So loving-jealous of his liberty.
1352 ROMEO
1353 I would I were thy bird.
1354 JULIET
1355 Sweet, so would I:
1356 Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
1357 Good night, good night! parting is such
1358 sweet sorrow,
1359 That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
1360 Exit above
1361 ROMEO
1362 Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
1363 Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
1364 Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
1365 His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
1366 Exit
1367 SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
1368 Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket
1369 FRIAR LAURENCE
1370 The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
1371 Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
1372 And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
1373 From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
1374 Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1375 The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1376 I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
1377 With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1378 The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
1379 What is her burying grave that is her womb,
1380 And from her womb children of divers kind
1381 We sucking on her natural bosom find,
1382 Many for many virtues excellent,
1383 None but for some and yet all different.
1384 O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1385 In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
1386 For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
1387 But to the earth some special good doth give,
1388 Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
1389 Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
1390 Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
1391 And vice sometimes by action dignified.
1392 Within the infant rind of this small flower
1393 Poison hath residence and medicine power:
1394 For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
1395 Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
1396 Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1397 In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
1398 And where the worser is predominant,
1399 Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
1400 Enter ROMEO
1401 ROMEO
1402 Good morrow, father.
1403 FRIAR LAURENCE
1404 Benedicite!
1405 What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1406 Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
1407 So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
1408 Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1409 And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
1410 But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
1411 Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
1412 Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1413 Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
1414 Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
1415 Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
1416 ROMEO
1417 That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
1418 FRIAR LAURENCE
1419 God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
1420 ROMEO
1421 With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
1422 I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
1423 FRIAR LAURENCE
1424 That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
1425 ROMEO
1426 I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
1427 I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1428 Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
1429 That's by me wounded: both our remedies
1430 Within thy help and holy physic lies:
1431 I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1432 My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1433 FRIAR LAURENCE
1434 Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
1435 Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
1436 ROMEO
1437 Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1438 On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
1439 As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
1440 And all combined, save what thou must combine
1441 By holy marriage: when and where and how
1442 We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
1443 I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
1444 That thou consent to marry us to-day.
1445 FRIAR LAURENCE
1446 Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
1447 Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
1448 So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
1449 Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1450 Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1451 Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1452 How much salt water thrown away in waste,
1453 To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1454 The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1455 Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
1456 Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1457 Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
1458 If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
1459 Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
1460 And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
1461 Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
1462 ROMEO
1463 Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
1464 FRIAR LAURENCE
1465 For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
1466 ROMEO
1467 And bad'st me bury love.
1468 FRIAR LAURENCE
1469 Not in a grave,
1470 To lay one in, another out to have.
1471 ROMEO
1472 I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
1473 Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
1474 The other did not so.
1475 FRIAR LAURENCE
1476 O, she knew well
1477 Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
1478 But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
1479 In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
1480 For this alliance may so happy prove,
1481 To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
1482 ROMEO
1483 O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
1484 FRIAR LAURENCE
1485 Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
1486 Exeunt
1487 SCENE IV. A street.
1488 Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
1489 MERCUTIO
1490 Where the devil should this Romeo be?
1491 Came he not home to-night?
1492 BENVOLIO
1493 Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
1494 MERCUTIO
1495 Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
1496 Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
1497 BENVOLIO
1498 Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
1499 Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
1500 MERCUTIO
1501 A challenge, on my life.
1502 BENVOLIO
1503 Romeo will answer it.
1504 MERCUTIO
1505 Any man that can write may answer a letter.
1506 BENVOLIO
1507 Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
1508 dares, being dared.
1509 MERCUTIO
1510 Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
1511 white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
1512 love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
1513 blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
1514 encounter Tybalt?
1515 BENVOLIO
1516 Why, what is Tybalt?
1517 MERCUTIO
1518 More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
1519 the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
1520 you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
1521 proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
1522 the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
1523 button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
1524 very first house, of the first and second cause:
1525 ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
1526 hai!
1527 BENVOLIO
1528 The what?
1529 MERCUTIO
1530 The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
1531 fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
1532 a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
1533 whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
1534 grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
1535 these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
1536 perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
1537 that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
1538 bones, their bones!
1539 Enter ROMEO
1540 BENVOLIO
1541 Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
1542 MERCUTIO
1543 Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
1544 how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
1545 that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
1546 kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
1547 be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
1548 Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
1549 eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
1550 Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
1551 to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
1552 fairly last night.
1553 ROMEO
1554 Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
1555 MERCUTIO
1556 The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
1557 ROMEO
1558 Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
1559 such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
1560 MERCUTIO
1561 That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
1562 constrains a man to bow in the hams.
1563 ROMEO
1564 Meaning, to court'sy.
1565 MERCUTIO
1566 Thou hast most kindly hit it.
1567 ROMEO
1568 A most courteous exposition.
1569 MERCUTIO
1570 Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
1571 ROMEO
1572 Pink for flower.
1573 MERCUTIO
1574 Right.
1575 ROMEO
1576 Why, then is my pump well flowered.
1577 MERCUTIO
1578 Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
1579 worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
1580 is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
1581 ROMEO
1582 O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
1583 singleness.
1584 MERCUTIO
1585 Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
1586 ROMEO
1587 Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
1588 MERCUTIO
1589 Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
1590 done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
1591 thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
1592 was I with you there for the goose?
1593 ROMEO
1594 Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
1595 not there for the goose.
1596 MERCUTIO
1597 I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
1598 ROMEO
1599 Nay, good goose, bite not.
1600 MERCUTIO
1601 Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
1602 sharp sauce.
1603 ROMEO
1604 And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
1605 MERCUTIO
1606 O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
1607 inch narrow to an ell broad!
1608 ROMEO
1609 I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
1610 to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
1611 MERCUTIO
1612 Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
1613 now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
1614 thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
1615 for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
1616 that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
1617 BENVOLIO
1618 Stop there, stop there.
1619 MERCUTIO
1620 Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
1621 BENVOLIO
1622 Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
1623 MERCUTIO
1624 O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
1625 for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
1626 meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
1627 ROMEO
1628 Here's goodly gear!
1629 Enter Nurse and PETER
1630 MERCUTIO
1631 A sail, a sail!
1632 BENVOLIO
1633 Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
1634 Nurse
1635 Peter!
1636 PETER
1637 Anon!
1638 Nurse
1639 My fan, Peter.
1640 MERCUTIO
1641 Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
1642 fairer face.
1643 Nurse
1644 God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
1645 MERCUTIO
1646 God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
1647 Nurse
1648 Is it good den?
1649 MERCUTIO
1650 'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
1651 dial is now upon the prick of noon.
1652 Nurse
1653 Out upon you! what a man are you!
1654 ROMEO
1655 One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
1656 mar.
1657 Nurse
1658 By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
1659 quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
1660 may find the young Romeo?
1661 ROMEO
1662 I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
1663 you have found him than he was when you sought him:
1664 I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
1665 Nurse
1666 You say well.
1667 MERCUTIO
1668 Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
1669 wisely, wisely.
1670 Nurse
1671 if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
1672 you.
1673 BENVOLIO
1674 She will indite him to some supper.
1675 MERCUTIO
1676 A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
1677 ROMEO
1678 What hast thou found?
1679 MERCUTIO
1680 No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
1681 that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
1682 Sings
1683 An old hare hoar,
1684 And an old hare hoar,
1685 Is very good meat in lent
1686 But a hare that is hoar
1687 Is too much for a score,
1688 When it hoars ere it be spent.
1689 Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
1690 to dinner, thither.
1691 ROMEO
1692 I will follow you.
1693 MERCUTIO
1694 Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
1695 Singing
1696 'lady, lady, lady.'
1697 Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
1698 Nurse
1699 Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
1700 merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
1701 ROMEO
1702 A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
1703 and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
1704 to in a month.
1705 Nurse
1706 An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
1707 down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
1708 Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
1709 Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
1710 none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
1711 too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
1712 PETER
1713 I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
1714 should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
1715 draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
1716 good quarrel, and the law on my side.
1717 Nurse
1718 Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
1719 me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
1720 and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
1721 out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
1722 but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
1723 a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
1724 kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
1725 is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
1726 with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
1727 to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
1728 ROMEO
1729 Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
1730 protest unto thee--
1731 Nurse
1732 Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
1733 Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
1734 ROMEO
1735 What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
1736 Nurse
1737 I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
1738 I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
1739 ROMEO
1740 Bid her devise
1741 Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
1742 And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
1743 Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
1744 Nurse
1745 No truly sir; not a penny.
1746 ROMEO
1747 Go to; I say you shall.
1748 Nurse
1749 This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
1750 ROMEO
1751 And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
1752 Within this hour my man shall be with thee
1753 And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
1754 Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
1755 Must be my convoy in the secret night.
1756 Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
1757 Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
1758 Nurse
1759 Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
1760 ROMEO
1761 What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
1762 Nurse
1763 Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
1764 Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
1765 ROMEO
1766 I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
1767 NURSE
1768 Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
1769 Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
1770 is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
1771 lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
1772 see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
1773 sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
1774 man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
1775 as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
1776 rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
1777 ROMEO
1778 Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
1779 Nurse
1780 Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
1781 the--No; I know it begins with some other
1782 letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
1783 it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
1784 to hear it.
1785 ROMEO
1786 Commend me to thy lady.
1787 Nurse
1788 Ay, a thousand times.
1789 Exit Romeo
1790 Peter!
1791 PETER
1792 Anon!
1793 Nurse
1794 Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
1795 Exeunt
1796 SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
1797 Enter JULIET
1798 JULIET
1799 The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
1800 In half an hour she promised to return.
1801 Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
1802 O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
1803 Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
1804 Driving back shadows over louring hills:
1805 Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
1806 And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
1807 Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
1808 Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
1809 Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
1810 Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
1811 She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
1812 My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
1813 And his to me:
1814 But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
1815 Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
1816 O God, she comes!
1817 Enter Nurse and PETER
1818 O honey nurse, what news?
1819 Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
1820 Nurse
1821 Peter, stay at the gate.
1822 Exit PETER
1823 JULIET
1824 Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
1825 Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
1826 If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
1827 By playing it to me with so sour a face.
1828 Nurse
1829 I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
1830 Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
1831 JULIET
1832 I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
1833 Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
1834 Nurse
1835 Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
1836 Do you not see that I am out of breath?
1837 JULIET
1838 How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
1839 To say to me that thou art out of breath?
1840 The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
1841 Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
1842 Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
1843 Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
1844 Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
1845 Nurse
1846 Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
1847 how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
1848 face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
1849 all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
1850 though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
1851 past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
1852 but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
1853 ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
1854 JULIET
1855 No, no: but all this did I know before.
1856 What says he of our marriage? what of that?
1857 Nurse
1858 Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
1859 It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
1860 My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
1861 Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
1862 To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
1863 JULIET
1864 I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
1865 Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
1866 Nurse
1867 Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
1868 courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
1869 warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
1870 JULIET
1871 Where is my mother! why, she is within;
1872 Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
1873 'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
1874 Where is your mother?'
1875 Nurse
1876 O God's lady dear!
1877 Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
1878 Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
1879 Henceforward do your messages yourself.
1880 JULIET
1881 Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
1882 Nurse
1883 Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
1884 JULIET
1885 I have.
1886 Nurse
1887 Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
1888 There stays a husband to make you a wife:
1889 Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
1890 They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
1891 Hie you to church; I must another way,
1892 To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
1893 Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
1894 I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
1895 But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
1896 Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
1897 JULIET
1898 Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
1899 Exeunt
1900 SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.
1901 Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO
1902 FRIAR LAURENCE
1903 So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
1904 That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
1905 ROMEO
1906 Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
1907 It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
1908 That one short minute gives me in her sight:
1909 Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
1910 Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
1911 It is enough I may but call her mine.
1912 FRIAR LAURENCE
1913 These violent delights have violent ends
1914 And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
1915 Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
1916 Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
1917 And in the taste confounds the appetite:
1918 Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
1919 Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
1920 Enter JULIET
1921 Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
1922 Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
1923 A lover may bestride the gossamer
1924 That idles in the wanton summer air,
1925 And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
1926 JULIET
1927 Good even to my ghostly confessor.
1928 FRIAR LAURENCE
1929 Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
1930 JULIET
1931 As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
1932 ROMEO
1933 Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
1934 Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
1935 To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
1936 This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
1937 Unfold the imagined happiness that both
1938 Receive in either by this dear encounter.
1939 JULIET
1940 Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
1941 Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
1942 They are but beggars that can count their worth;
1943 But my true love is grown to such excess
1944 I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
1945 FRIAR LAURENCE
1946 Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
1947 For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
1948 Till holy church incorporate two in one.
1949 Exeunt
1950 ACT III
1951 SCENE I. A public place.
1952 Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
1953 BENVOLIO
1954 I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
1955 The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
1956 And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
1957 For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
1958 MERCUTIO
1959 Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
1960 enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
1961 upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
1962 thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
1963 it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
1964 BENVOLIO
1965 Am I like such a fellow?
1966 MERCUTIO
1967 Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
1968 any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
1969 soon moody to be moved.
1970 BENVOLIO
1971 And what to?
1972 MERCUTIO
1973 Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
1974 shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
1975 thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
1976 or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
1977 wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
1978 other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
1979 eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
1980 Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
1981 meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
1982 an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
1983 man for coughing in the street, because he hath
1984 wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
1985 didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
1986 his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
1987 tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
1988 wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
1989 BENVOLIO
1990 An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
1991 should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
1992 MERCUTIO
1993 The fee-simple! O simple!
1994 BENVOLIO
1995 By my head, here come the Capulets.
1996 MERCUTIO
1997 By my heel, I care not.
1998 Enter TYBALT and others
1999 TYBALT
2000 Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
2001 Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
2002 MERCUTIO
2003 And but one word with one of us? couple it with
2004 something; make it a word and a blow.
2005 TYBALT
2006 You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
2007 will give me occasion.
2008 MERCUTIO
2009 Could you not take some occasion without giving?
2010 TYBALT
2011 Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
2012 MERCUTIO
2013 Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
2014 thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
2015 discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
2016 make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
2017 BENVOLIO
2018 We talk here in the public haunt of men:
2019 Either withdraw unto some private place,
2020 And reason coldly of your grievances,
2021 Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
2022 MERCUTIO
2023 Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
2024 I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
2025 Enter ROMEO
2026 TYBALT
2027 Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
2028 MERCUTIO
2029 But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
2030 Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
2031 Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
2032 TYBALT
2033 Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
2034 No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
2035 ROMEO
2036 Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2037 Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2038 To such a greeting: villain am I none;
2039 Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
2040 TYBALT
2041 Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2042 That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
2043 ROMEO
2044 I do protest, I never injured thee,
2045 But love thee better than thou canst devise,
2046 Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
2047 And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
2048 As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
2049 MERCUTIO
2050 O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
2051 Alla stoccata carries it away.
2052 Draws
2053 Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
2054 TYBALT
2055 What wouldst thou have with me?
2056 MERCUTIO
2057 Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
2058 lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
2059 shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
2060 eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
2061 by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
2062 ears ere it be out.
2063 TYBALT
2064 I am for you.
2065 Drawing
2066 ROMEO
2067 Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2068 MERCUTIO
2069 Come, sir, your passado.
2070 They fight
2071 ROMEO
2072 Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
2073 Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
2074 Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
2075 Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
2076 Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
2077 TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers
2078 MERCUTIO
2079 I am hurt.
2080 A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
2081 Is he gone, and hath nothing?
2082 BENVOLIO
2083 What, art thou hurt?
2084 MERCUTIO
2085 Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
2086 Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2087 Exit Page
2088 ROMEO
2089 Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
2090 MERCUTIO
2091 No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
2092 church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
2093 me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
2094 am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
2095 both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
2096 cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
2097 rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
2098 arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
2099 was hurt under your arm.
2100 ROMEO
2101 I thought all for the best.
2102 MERCUTIO
2103 Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2104 Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
2105 They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
2106 And soundly too: your houses!
2107 Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
2108 ROMEO
2109 This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
2110 My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
2111 In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
2112 With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
2113 Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
2114 Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2115 And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
2116 Re-enter BENVOLIO
2117 BENVOLIO
2118 O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
2119 That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
2120 Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2121 ROMEO
2122 This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
2123 This but begins the woe, others must end.
2124 BENVOLIO
2125 Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2126 ROMEO
2127 Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
2128 Away to heaven, respective lenity,
2129 And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
2130 Re-enter TYBALT
2131 Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
2132 That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
2133 Is but a little way above our heads,
2134 Staying for thine to keep him company:
2135 Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
2136 TYBALT
2137 Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
2138 Shalt with him hence.
2139 ROMEO
2140 This shall determine that.
2141 They fight; TYBALT falls
2142 BENVOLIO
2143 Romeo, away, be gone!
2144 The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
2145 Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
2146 If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
2147 ROMEO
2148 O, I am fortune's fool!
2149 BENVOLIO
2150 Why dost thou stay?
2151 Exit ROMEO
2152 Enter Citizens, & c
2153 First Citizen
2154 Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
2155 Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
2156 BENVOLIO
2157 There lies that Tybalt.
2158 First Citizen
2159 Up, sir, go with me;
2160 I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
2161 Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others
2162 PRINCE
2163 Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2164 BENVOLIO
2165 O noble prince, I can discover all
2166 The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
2167 There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2168 That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2169 LADY CAPULET
2170 Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
2171 O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
2172 O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
2173 For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
2174 O cousin, cousin!
2175 PRINCE
2176 Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2177 BENVOLIO
2178 Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
2179 Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
2180 How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
2181 Your high displeasure: all this uttered
2182 With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
2183 Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2184 Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2185 With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
2186 Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
2187 And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2188 Cold death aside, and with the other sends
2189 It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
2190 Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
2191 'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
2192 his tongue,
2193 His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2194 And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2195 An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2196 Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
2197 But by and by comes back to Romeo,
2198 Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
2199 And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
2200 Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
2201 And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
2202 This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2203 LADY CAPULET
2204 He is a kinsman to the Montague;
2205 Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
2206 Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2207 And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2208 I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
2209 Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
2210 PRINCE
2211 Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
2212 Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2213 MONTAGUE
2214 Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
2215 His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2216 The life of Tybalt.
2217 PRINCE
2218 And for that offence
2219 Immediately we do exile him hence:
2220 I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
2221 My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
2222 But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2223 That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
2224 I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
2225 Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
2226 Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
2227 Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
2228 Bear hence this body and attend our will:
2229 Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
2230 Exeunt
2231 SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
2232 Enter JULIET
2233 JULIET
2234 Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2235 Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
2236 As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
2237 And bring in cloudy night immediately.
2238 Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
2239 That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
2240 Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
2241 Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2242 By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
2243 It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
2244 Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
2245 And learn me how to lose a winning match,
2246 Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
2247 Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
2248 With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
2249 Think true love acted simple modesty.
2250 Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
2251 For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2252 Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
2253 Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
2254 Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
2255 Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2256 And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2257 That all the world will be in love with night
2258 And pay no worship to the garish sun.
2259 O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
2260 But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
2261 Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
2262 As is the night before some festival
2263 To an impatient child that hath new robes
2264 And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
2265 And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
2266 But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
2267 Enter Nurse, with cords
2268 Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
2269 That Romeo bid thee fetch?
2270 Nurse
2271 Ay, ay, the cords.
2272 Throws them down
2273 JULIET
2274 Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
2275 Nurse
2276 Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
2277 We are undone, lady, we are undone!
2278 Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
2279 JULIET
2280 Can heaven be so envious?
2281 Nurse
2282 Romeo can,
2283 Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
2284 Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
2285 JULIET
2286 What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
2287 This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
2288 Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
2289 And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
2290 Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
2291 I am not I, if there be such an I;
2292 Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
2293 If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
2294 Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
2295 Nurse
2296 I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
2297 God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
2298 A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
2299 Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
2300 All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
2301 JULIET
2302 O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
2303 To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
2304 Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
2305 And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
2306 Nurse
2307 O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2308 O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
2309 That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2310 JULIET
2311 What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2312 Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
2313 My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
2314 Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
2315 For who is living, if those two are gone?
2316 Nurse
2317 Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
2318 Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
2319 JULIET
2320 O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2321 Nurse
2322 It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
2323 JULIET
2324 O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
2325 Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2326 Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
2327 Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
2328 Despised substance of divinest show!
2329 Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
2330 A damned saint, an honourable villain!
2331 O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
2332 When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2333 In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
2334 Was ever book containing such vile matter
2335 So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
2336 In such a gorgeous palace!
2337 Nurse
2338 There's no trust,
2339 No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
2340 All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
2341 Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
2342 These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
2343 Shame come to Romeo!
2344 JULIET
2345 Blister'd be thy tongue
2346 For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
2347 Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
2348 For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
2349 Sole monarch of the universal earth.
2350 O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2351 Nurse
2352 Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
2353 JULIET
2354 Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2355 Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
2356 When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
2357 But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2358 That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
2359 Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
2360 Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2361 Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2362 My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
2363 And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
2364 All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
2365 Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
2366 That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
2367 But, O, it presses to my memory,
2368 Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
2369 'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
2370 That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
2371 Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
2372 Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
2373 Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
2374 And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
2375 Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
2376 Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
2377 Which modern lamentations might have moved?
2378 But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
2379 'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
2380 Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
2381 All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
2382 There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
2383 In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
2384 Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
2385 Nurse
2386 Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
2387 Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
2388 JULIET
2389 Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
2390 When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
2391 Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
2392 Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
2393 He made you for a highway to my bed;
2394 But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
2395 Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
2396 And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
2397 Nurse
2398 Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
2399 To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
2400 Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
2401 I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
2402 JULIET
2403 O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
2404 And bid him come to take his last farewell.
2405 Exeunt
2406 SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
2407 Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
2408 FRIAR LAURENCE
2409 Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
2410 Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
2411 And thou art wedded to calamity.
2412 Enter ROMEO
2413 ROMEO
2414 Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
2415 What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
2416 That I yet know not?
2417 FRIAR LAURENCE
2418 Too familiar
2419 Is my dear son with such sour company:
2420 I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
2421 ROMEO
2422 What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
2423 FRIAR LAURENCE
2424 A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
2425 Not body's death, but body's banishment.
2426 ROMEO
2427 Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
2428 For exile hath more terror in his look,
2429 Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
2430 FRIAR LAURENCE
2431 Hence from Verona art thou banished:
2432 Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
2433 ROMEO
2434 There is no world without Verona walls,
2435 But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
2436 Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
2437 And world's exile is death: then banished,
2438 Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
2439 Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
2440 And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
2441 FRIAR LAURENCE
2442 O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
2443 Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
2444 Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
2445 And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
2446 This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
2447 ROMEO
2448 'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
2449 Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
2450 And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
2451 Live here in heaven and may look on her;
2452 But Romeo may not: more validity,
2453 More honourable state, more courtship lives
2454 In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
2455 On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
2456 And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2457 Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
2458 Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2459 But Romeo may not; he is banished:
2460 Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
2461 They are free men, but I am banished.
2462 And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
2463 Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
2464 No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2465 But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
2466 O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
2467 Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
2468 Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2469 A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
2470 To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
2471 FRIAR LAURENCE
2472 Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
2473 ROMEO
2474 O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
2475 FRIAR LAURENCE
2476 I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
2477 Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2478 To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
2479 ROMEO
2480 Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
2481 Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2482 Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2483 It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
2484 FRIAR LAURENCE
2485 O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
2486 ROMEO
2487 How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
2488 FRIAR LAURENCE
2489 Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
2490 ROMEO
2491 Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
2492 Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
2493 An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
2494 Doting like me and like me banished,
2495 Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
2496 And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
2497 Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
2498 Knocking within
2499 FRIAR LAURENCE
2500 Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
2501 ROMEO
2502 Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
2503 Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
2504 Knocking
2505 FRIAR LAURENCE
2506 Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
2507 Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
2508 Knocking
2509 Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
2510 What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
2511 Knocking
2512 Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
2513 Nurse
2514 [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
2515 my errand;
2516 I come from Lady Juliet.
2517 FRIAR LAURENCE
2518 Welcome, then.
2519 Enter Nurse
2520 Nurse
2521 O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
2522 Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
2523 FRIAR LAURENCE
2524 There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
2525 Nurse
2526 O, he is even in my mistress' case,
2527 Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
2528 Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
2529 Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
2530 Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
2531 For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
2532 Why should you fall into so deep an O?
2533 ROMEO
2534 Nurse!
2535 Nurse
2536 Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
2537 ROMEO
2538 Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
2539 Doth she not think me an old murderer,
2540 Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
2541 With blood removed but little from her own?
2542 Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
2543 My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
2544 Nurse
2545 O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
2546 And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
2547 And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
2548 And then down falls again.
2549 ROMEO
2550 As if that name,
2551 Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2552 Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
2553 Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2554 In what vile part of this anatomy
2555 Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
2556 The hateful mansion.
2557 Drawing his sword
2558 FRIAR LAURENCE
2559 Hold thy desperate hand:
2560 Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
2561 Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
2562 The unreasonable fury of a beast:
2563 Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2564 Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2565 Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
2566 I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2567 Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
2568 And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
2569 By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2570 Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
2571 Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
2572 In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2573 Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
2574 Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2575 And usest none in that true use indeed
2576 Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
2577 Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
2578 Digressing from the valour of a man;
2579 Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2580 Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
2581 Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2582 Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2583 Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
2584 Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
2585 And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
2586 What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
2587 For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
2588 There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
2589 But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
2590 The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
2591 And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
2592 A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
2593 Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2594 But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
2595 Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
2596 Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2597 Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2598 Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
2599 But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2600 For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
2601 Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
2602 To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2603 Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
2604 With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2605 Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
2606 Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
2607 And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2608 Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
2609 Romeo is coming.
2610 Nurse
2611 O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
2612 To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
2613 My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
2614 ROMEO
2615 Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
2616 Nurse
2617 Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
2618 Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
2619 Exit
2620 ROMEO
2621 How well my comfort is revived by this!
2622 FRIAR LAURENCE
2623 Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
2624 Either be gone before the watch be set,
2625 Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
2626 Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
2627 And he shall signify from time to time
2628 Every good hap to you that chances here:
2629 Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
2630 ROMEO
2631 But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
2632 It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
2633 Exeunt
2634 SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
2635 Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS
2636 CAPULET
2637 Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
2638 That we have had no time to move our daughter:
2639 Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
2640 And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
2641 'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
2642 I promise you, but for your company,
2643 I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
2644 PARIS
2645 These times of woe afford no time to woo.
2646 Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
2647 LADY CAPULET
2648 I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
2649 To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
2650 CAPULET
2651 Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
2652 Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
2653 In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
2654 Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
2655 Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
2656 And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
2657 But, soft! what day is this?
2658 PARIS
2659 Monday, my lord,
2660 CAPULET
2661 Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
2662 O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
2663 She shall be married to this noble earl.
2664 Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
2665 We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
2666 For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
2667 It may be thought we held him carelessly,
2668 Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
2669 Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
2670 And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
2671 PARIS
2672 My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
2673 CAPULET
2674 Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
2675 Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
2676 Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
2677 Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
2678 Afore me! it is so very very late,
2679 That we may call it early by and by.
2680 Good night.
2681 Exeunt
2682 SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
2683 Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window
2684 JULIET
2685 Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
2686 It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
2687 That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
2688 Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
2689 Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
2690 ROMEO
2691 It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
2692 No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
2693 Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
2694 Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
2695 Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
2696 I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
2697 JULIET
2698 Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
2699 It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
2700 To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
2701 And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
2702 Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
2703 ROMEO
2704 Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
2705 I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
2706 I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
2707 'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
2708 Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
2709 The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
2710 I have more care to stay than will to go:
2711 Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
2712 How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
2713 JULIET
2714 It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
2715 It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
2716 Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
2717 Some say the lark makes sweet division;
2718 This doth not so, for she divideth us:
2719 Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
2720 O, now I would they had changed voices too!
2721 Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
2722 Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
2723 O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
2724 ROMEO
2725 More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
2726 Enter Nurse, to the chamber
2727 Nurse
2728 Madam!
2729 JULIET
2730 Nurse?
2731 Nurse
2732 Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
2733 The day is broke; be wary, look about.
2734 Exit
2735 JULIET
2736 Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
2737 ROMEO
2738 Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
2739 He goeth down
2740 JULIET
2741 Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
2742 I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
2743 For in a minute there are many days:
2744 O, by this count I shall be much in years
2745 Ere I again behold my Romeo!
2746 ROMEO
2747 Farewell!
2748 I will omit no opportunity
2749 That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
2750 JULIET
2751 O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
2752 ROMEO
2753 I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
2754 For sweet discourses in our time to come.
2755 JULIET
2756 O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
2757 Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
2758 As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
2759 Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
2760 ROMEO
2761 And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
2762 Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
2763 Exit
2764 JULIET
2765 O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
2766 If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
2767 That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
2768 For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
2769 But send him back.
2770 LADY CAPULET
2771 [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
2772 JULIET
2773 Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
2774 Is she not down so late, or up so early?
2775 What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
2776 Enter LADY CAPULET
2777 LADY CAPULET
2778 Why, how now, Juliet!
2779 JULIET
2780 Madam, I am not well.
2781 LADY CAPULET
2782 Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
2783 What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
2784 An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
2785 Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
2786 But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
2787 JULIET
2788 Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
2789 LADY CAPULET
2790 So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
2791 Which you weep for.
2792 JULIET
2793 Feeling so the loss,
2794 Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
2795 LADY CAPULET
2796 Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
2797 As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
2798 JULIET
2799 What villain madam?
2800 LADY CAPULET
2801 That same villain, Romeo.
2802 JULIET
2803 [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
2804 God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
2805 And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
2806 LADY CAPULET
2807 That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
2808 JULIET
2809 Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
2810 Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
2811 LADY CAPULET
2812 We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
2813 Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
2814 Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
2815 Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
2816 That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
2817 And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
2818 JULIET
2819 Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
2820 With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
2821 Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
2822 Madam, if you could find out but a man
2823 To bear a poison, I would temper it;
2824 That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
2825 Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
2826 To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
2827 To wreak the love I bore my cousin
2828 Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
2829 LADY CAPULET
2830 Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
2831 But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
2832 JULIET
2833 And joy comes well in such a needy time:
2834 What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
2835 LADY CAPULET
2836 Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
2837 One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
2838 Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
2839 That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
2840 JULIET
2841 Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
2842 LADY CAPULET
2843 Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
2844 The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
2845 The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
2846 Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
2847 JULIET
2848 Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
2849 He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
2850 I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
2851 Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
2852 I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
2853 I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
2854 It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
2855 Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
2856 LADY CAPULET
2857 Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
2858 And see how he will take it at your hands.
2859 Enter CAPULET and Nurse
2860 CAPULET
2861 When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
2862 But for the sunset of my brother's son
2863 It rains downright.
2864 How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
2865 Evermore showering? In one little body
2866 Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
2867 For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
2868 Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
2869 Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
2870 Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
2871 Without a sudden calm, will overset
2872 Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
2873 Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
2874 LADY CAPULET
2875 Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
2876 I would the fool were married to her grave!
2877 CAPULET
2878 Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
2879 How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
2880 Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
2881 Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
2882 So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
2883 JULIET
2884 Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
2885 Proud can I never be of what I hate;
2886 But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
2887 CAPULET
2888 How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
2889 'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
2890 And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
2891 Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
2892 But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
2893 To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
2894 Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
2895 Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
2896 You tallow-face!
2897 LADY CAPULET
2898 Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
2899 JULIET
2900 Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
2901 Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
2902 CAPULET
2903 Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
2904 I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
2905 Or never after look me in the face:
2906 Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
2907 My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
2908 That God had lent us but this only child;
2909 But now I see this one is one too much,
2910 And that we have a curse in having her:
2911 Out on her, hilding!
2912 Nurse
2913 God in heaven bless her!
2914 You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
2915 CAPULET
2916 And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
2917 Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
2918 Nurse
2919 I speak no treason.
2920 CAPULET
2921 O, God ye god-den.
2922 Nurse
2923 May not one speak?
2924 CAPULET
2925 Peace, you mumbling fool!
2926 Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
2927 For here we need it not.
2928 LADY CAPULET
2929 You are too hot.
2930 CAPULET
2931 God's bread! it makes me mad:
2932 Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
2933 Alone, in company, still my care hath been
2934 To have her match'd: and having now provided
2935 A gentleman of noble parentage,
2936 Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
2937 Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
2938 Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
2939 And then to have a wretched puling fool,
2940 A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
2941 To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
2942 I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
2943 But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
2944 Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
2945 Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
2946 Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
2947 An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
2948 And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
2949 the streets,
2950 For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
2951 Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
2952 Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
2953 Exit
2954 JULIET
2955 Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
2956 That sees into the bottom of my grief?
2957 O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
2958 Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
2959 Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
2960 In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
2961 LADY CAPULET
2962 Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
2963 Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
2964 Exit
2965 JULIET
2966 O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
2967 My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
2968 How shall that faith return again to earth,
2969 Unless that husband send it me from heaven
2970 By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
2971 Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
2972 Upon so soft a subject as myself!
2973 What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
2974 Some comfort, nurse.
2975 Nurse
2976 Faith, here it is.
2977 Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
2978 That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
2979 Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
2980 Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
2981 I think it best you married with the county.
2982 O, he's a lovely gentleman!
2983 Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
2984 Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
2985 As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
2986 I think you are happy in this second match,
2987 For it excels your first: or if it did not,
2988 Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
2989 As living here and you no use of him.
2990 JULIET
2991 Speakest thou from thy heart?
2992 Nurse
2993 And from my soul too;
2994 Or else beshrew them both.
2995 JULIET
2996 Amen!
2997 Nurse
2998 What?
2999 JULIET
3000 Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
3001 Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
3002 Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
3003 To make confession and to be absolved.
3004 Nurse
3005 Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
3006 Exit
3007 JULIET
3008 Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
3009 Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
3010 Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
3011 Which she hath praised him with above compare
3012 So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
3013 Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
3014 I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
3015 If all else fail, myself have power to die.
3016 Exit
3017 ACT IV
3018 SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
3019 Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
3020 FRIAR LAURENCE
3021 On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
3022 PARIS
3023 My father Capulet will have it so;
3024 And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
3025 FRIAR LAURENCE
3026 You say you do not know the lady's mind:
3027 Uneven is the course, I like it not.
3028 PARIS
3029 Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
3030 And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
3031 For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
3032 Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
3033 That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
3034 And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
3035 To stop the inundation of her tears;
3036 Which, too much minded by herself alone,
3037 May be put from her by society:
3038 Now do you know the reason of this haste.
3039 FRIAR LAURENCE
3040 [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
3041 Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
3042 Enter JULIET
3043 PARIS
3044 Happily met, my lady and my wife!
3045 JULIET
3046 That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
3047 PARIS
3048 That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
3049 JULIET
3050 What must be shall be.
3051 FRIAR LAURENCE
3052 That's a certain text.
3053 PARIS
3054 Come you to make confession to this father?
3055 JULIET
3056 To answer that, I should confess to you.
3057 PARIS
3058 Do not deny to him that you love me.
3059 JULIET
3060 I will confess to you that I love him.
3061 PARIS
3062 So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
3063 JULIET
3064 If I do so, it will be of more price,
3065 Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
3066 PARIS
3067 Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
3068 JULIET
3069 The tears have got small victory by that;
3070 For it was bad enough before their spite.
3071 PARIS
3072 Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
3073 JULIET
3074 That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
3075 And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
3076 PARIS
3077 Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
3078 JULIET
3079 It may be so, for it is not mine own.
3080 Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
3081 Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
3082 FRIAR LAURENCE
3083 My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
3084 My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
3085 PARIS
3086 God shield I should disturb devotion!
3087 Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
3088 Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
3089 Exit
3090 JULIET
3091 O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
3092 Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
3093 FRIAR LAURENCE
3094 Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
3095 It strains me past the compass of my wits:
3096 I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
3097 On Thursday next be married to this county.
3098 JULIET
3099 Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
3100 Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
3101 If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
3102 Do thou but call my resolution wise,
3103 And with this knife I'll help it presently.
3104 God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
3105 And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
3106 Shall be the label to another deed,
3107 Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
3108 Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
3109 Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
3110 Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
3111 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
3112 Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
3113 Which the commission of thy years and art
3114 Could to no issue of true honour bring.
3115 Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
3116 If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
3117 FRIAR LAURENCE
3118 Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
3119 Which craves as desperate an execution.
3120 As that is desperate which we would prevent.
3121 If, rather than to marry County Paris,
3122 Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
3123 Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
3124 A thing like death to chide away this shame,
3125 That copest with death himself to scape from it:
3126 And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
3127 JULIET
3128 O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
3129 From off the battlements of yonder tower;
3130 Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
3131 Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
3132 Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
3133 O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
3134 With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
3135 Or bid me go into a new-made grave
3136 And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
3137 Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
3138 And I will do it without fear or doubt,
3139 To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
3140 FRIAR LAURENCE
3141 Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
3142 To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
3143 To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
3144 Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
3145 Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
3146 And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
3147 When presently through all thy veins shall run
3148 A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
3149 Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
3150 No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
3151 The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
3152 To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
3153 Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
3154 Each part, deprived of supple government,
3155 Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
3156 And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
3157 Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
3158 And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
3159 Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
3160 To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
3161 Then, as the manner of our country is,
3162 In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
3163 Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
3164 Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
3165 In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
3166 Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
3167 And hither shall he come: and he and I
3168 Will watch thy waking, and that very night
3169 Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
3170 And this shall free thee from this present shame;
3171 If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
3172 Abate thy valour in the acting it.
3173 JULIET
3174 Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
3175 FRIAR LAURENCE
3176 Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
3177 In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
3178 To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
3179 JULIET
3180 Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
3181 Farewell, dear father!
3182 Exeunt
3183 SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
3184 Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen
3185 CAPULET
3186 So many guests invite as here are writ.
3187 Exit First Servant
3188 Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
3189 Second Servant
3190 You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
3191 can lick their fingers.
3192 CAPULET
3193 How canst thou try them so?
3194 Second Servant
3195 Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
3196 own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
3197 fingers goes not with me.
3198 CAPULET
3199 Go, be gone.
3200 Exit Second Servant
3201 We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
3202 What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
3203 Nurse
3204 Ay, forsooth.
3205 CAPULET
3206 Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
3207 A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
3208 Nurse
3209 See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
3210 Enter JULIET
3211 CAPULET
3212 How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
3213 JULIET
3214 Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
3215 Of disobedient opposition
3216 To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
3217 By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
3218 And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
3219 Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
3220 CAPULET
3221 Send for the county; go tell him of this:
3222 I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
3223 JULIET
3224 I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
3225 And gave him what becomed love I might,
3226 Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
3227 CAPULET
3228 Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
3229 This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
3230 Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
3231 Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
3232 Our whole city is much bound to him.
3233 JULIET
3234 Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
3235 To help me sort such needful ornaments
3236 As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
3237 LADY CAPULET
3238 No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
3239 CAPULET
3240 Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
3241 Exeunt JULIET and Nurse
3242 LADY CAPULET
3243 We shall be short in our provision:
3244 'Tis now near night.
3245 CAPULET
3246 Tush, I will stir about,
3247 And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
3248 Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
3249 I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
3250 I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
3251 They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
3252 To County Paris, to prepare him up
3253 Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
3254 Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
3255 Exeunt
3256 SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.
3257 Enter JULIET and Nurse
3258 JULIET
3259 Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
3260 I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
3261 For I have need of many orisons
3262 To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
3263 Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
3264 Enter LADY CAPULET
3265 LADY CAPULET
3266 What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
3267 JULIET
3268 No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
3269 As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
3270 So please you, let me now be left alone,
3271 And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
3272 For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
3273 In this so sudden business.
3274 LADY CAPULET
3275 Good night:
3276 Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
3277 Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
3278 JULIET
3279 Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
3280 I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
3281 That almost freezes up the heat of life:
3282 I'll call them back again to comfort me:
3283 Nurse! What should she do here?
3284 My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
3285 Come, vial.
3286 What if this mixture do not work at all?
3287 Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
3288 No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
3289 Laying down her dagger
3290 What if it be a poison, which the friar
3291 Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
3292 Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
3293 Because he married me before to Romeo?
3294 I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
3295 For he hath still been tried a holy man.
3296 How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
3297 I wake before the time that Romeo
3298 Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
3299 Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
3300 To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
3301 And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
3302 Or, if I live, is it not very like,
3303 The horrible conceit of death and night,
3304 Together with the terror of the place,--
3305 As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
3306 Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
3307 Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
3308 Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
3309 Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
3310 At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
3311 Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
3312 So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
3313 And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
3314 That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
3315 O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
3316 Environed with all these hideous fears?
3317 And madly play with my forefather's joints?
3318 And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
3319 And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
3320 As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
3321 O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
3322 Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
3323 Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
3324 Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
3325 She falls upon her bed, within the curtains
3326 SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.
3327 Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
3328 LADY CAPULET
3329 Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
3330 Nurse
3331 They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
3332 Enter CAPULET
3333 CAPULET
3334 Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
3335 The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
3336 Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
3337 Spare not for the cost.
3338 Nurse
3339 Go, you cot-quean, go,
3340 Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
3341 For this night's watching.
3342 CAPULET
3343 No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
3344 All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
3345 LADY CAPULET
3346 Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
3347 But I will watch you from such watching now.
3348 Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
3349 CAPULET
3350 A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
3351 Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets
3352 Now, fellow,
3353 What's there?
3354 First Servant
3355 Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
3356 CAPULET
3357 Make haste, make haste.
3358 Exit First Servant
3359 Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
3360 Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
3361 Second Servant
3362 I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
3363 And never trouble Peter for the matter.
3364 Exit
3365 CAPULET
3366 Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
3367 Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
3368 The county will be here with music straight,
3369 For so he said he would: I hear him near.
3370 Music within
3371 Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
3372 Re-enter Nurse
3373 Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
3374 I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
3375 Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
3376 Make haste, I say.
3377 Exeunt
3378 SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.
3379 Enter Nurse
3380 Nurse
3381 Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
3382 Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
3383 Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
3384 What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
3385 Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
3386 The County Paris hath set up his rest,
3387 That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
3388 Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
3389 I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
3390 Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
3391 He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
3392 Undraws the curtains
3393 What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
3394 I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
3395 Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
3396 O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
3397 Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
3398 Enter LADY CAPULET
3399 LADY CAPULET
3400 What noise is here?
3401 Nurse
3402 O lamentable day!
3403 LADY CAPULET
3404 What is the matter?
3405 Nurse
3406 Look, look! O heavy day!
3407 LADY CAPULET
3408 O me, O me! My child, my only life,
3409 Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
3410 Help, help! Call help.
3411 Enter CAPULET
3412 CAPULET
3413 For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
3414 Nurse
3415 She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
3416 LADY CAPULET
3417 Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
3418 CAPULET
3419 Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
3420 Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
3421 Life and these lips have long been separated:
3422 Death lies on her like an untimely frost
3423 Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
3424 Nurse
3425 O lamentable day!
3426 LADY CAPULET
3427 O woful time!
3428 CAPULET
3429 Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
3430 Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
3431 Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians
3432 FRIAR LAURENCE
3433 Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
3434 CAPULET
3435 Ready to go, but never to return.
3436 O son! the night before thy wedding-day
3437 Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
3438 Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
3439 Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
3440 My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
3441 And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
3442 PARIS
3443 Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
3444 And doth it give me such a sight as this?
3445 LADY CAPULET
3446 Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
3447 Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
3448 In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
3449 But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
3450 But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
3451 And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
3452 Nurse
3453 O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
3454 Most lamentable day, most woful day,
3455 That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
3456 O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
3457 Never was seen so black a day as this:
3458 O woful day, O woful day!
3459 PARIS
3460 Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
3461 Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
3462 By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
3463 O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
3464 CAPULET
3465 Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
3466 Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
3467 To murder, murder our solemnity?
3468 O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
3469 Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
3470 And with my child my joys are buried.
3471 FRIAR LAURENCE
3472 Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
3473 In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
3474 Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
3475 And all the better is it for the maid:
3476 Your part in her you could not keep from death,
3477 But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
3478 The most you sought was her promotion;
3479 For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
3480 And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
3481 Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
3482 O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
3483 That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
3484 She's not well married that lives married long;
3485 But she's best married that dies married young.
3486 Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
3487 On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
3488 In all her best array bear her to church:
3489 For though fond nature bids us an lament,
3490 Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
3491 CAPULET
3492 All things that we ordained festival,
3493 Turn from their office to black funeral;
3494 Our instruments to melancholy bells,
3495 Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
3496 Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
3497 Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
3498 And all things change them to the contrary.
3499 FRIAR LAURENCE
3500 Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
3501 And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
3502 To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
3503 The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
3504 Move them no more by crossing their high will.
3505 Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE
3506 First Musician
3507 Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
3508 Nurse
3509 Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
3510 For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
3511 Exit
3512 First Musician
3513 Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
3514 Enter PETER
3515 PETER
3516 Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
3517 ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
3518 First Musician
3519 Why 'Heart's ease?'
3520 PETER
3521 O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
3522 heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
3523 to comfort me.
3524 First Musician
3525 Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
3526 PETER
3527 You will not, then?
3528 First Musician
3529 No.
3530 PETER
3531 I will then give it you soundly.
3532 First Musician
3533 What will you give us?
3534 PETER
3535 No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
3536 I will give you the minstrel.
3537 First Musician
3538 Then I will give you the serving-creature.
3539 PETER
3540 Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
3541 your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
3542 I'll fa you; do you note me?
3543 First Musician
3544 An you re us and fa us, you note us.
3545 Second Musician
3546 Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
3547 PETER
3548 Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
3549 with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
3550 me like men:
3551 'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
3552 And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
3553 Then music with her silver sound'--
3554 why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
3555 sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
3556 Musician
3557 Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
3558 PETER
3559 Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
3560 Second Musician
3561 I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
3562 PETER
3563 Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
3564 Third Musician
3565 Faith, I know not what to say.
3566 PETER
3567 O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
3568 for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
3569 because musicians have no gold for sounding:
3570 'Then music with her silver sound
3571 With speedy help doth lend redress.'
3572 Exit
3573 First Musician
3574 What a pestilent knave is this same!
3575 Second Musician
3576 Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
3577 mourners, and stay dinner.
3578 Exeunt
3579 ACT V
3580 SCENE I. Mantua. A street.
3581 Enter ROMEO
3582 ROMEO
3583 If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
3584 My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
3585 My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
3586 And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
3587 Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
3588 I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
3589 Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
3590 to think!--
3591 And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
3592 That I revived, and was an emperor.
3593 Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
3594 When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
3595 Enter BALTHASAR, booted
3596 News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
3597 Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
3598 How doth my lady? Is my father well?
3599 How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
3600 For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
3601 BALTHASAR
3602 Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
3603 Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
3604 And her immortal part with angels lives.
3605 I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
3606 And presently took post to tell it you:
3607 O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
3608 Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
3609 ROMEO
3610 Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
3611 Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
3612 And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
3613 BALTHASAR
3614 I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
3615 Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
3616 Some misadventure.
3617 ROMEO
3618 Tush, thou art deceived:
3619 Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
3620 Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
3621 BALTHASAR
3622 No, my good lord.
3623 ROMEO
3624 No matter: get thee gone,
3625 And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
3626 Exit BALTHASAR
3627 Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
3628 Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
3629 To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
3630 I do remember an apothecary,--
3631 And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
3632 In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
3633 Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
3634 Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
3635 And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
3636 An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
3637 Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
3638 A beggarly account of empty boxes,
3639 Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
3640 Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
3641 Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
3642 Noting this penury, to myself I said
3643 'An if a man did need a poison now,
3644 Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
3645 Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
3646 O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
3647 And this same needy man must sell it me.
3648 As I remember, this should be the house.
3649 Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
3650 What, ho! apothecary!
3651 Enter Apothecary
3652 Apothecary
3653 Who calls so loud?
3654 ROMEO
3655 Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
3656 Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
3657 A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
3658 As will disperse itself through all the veins
3659 That the life-weary taker may fall dead
3660 And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
3661 As violently as hasty powder fired
3662 Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
3663 Apothecary
3664 Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
3665 Is death to any he that utters them.
3666 ROMEO
3667 Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
3668 And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
3669 Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
3670 Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
3671 The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
3672 The world affords no law to make thee rich;
3673 Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
3674 Apothecary
3675 My poverty, but not my will, consents.
3676 ROMEO
3677 I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
3678 Apothecary
3679 Put this in any liquid thing you will,
3680 And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
3681 Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
3682 ROMEO
3683 There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
3684 Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
3685 Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
3686 I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
3687 Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
3688 Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
3689 To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
3690 Exeunt
3691 SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.
3692 Enter FRIAR JOHN
3693 FRIAR JOHN
3694 Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
3695 Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
3696 FRIAR LAURENCE
3697 This same should be the voice of Friar John.
3698 Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
3699 Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
3700 FRIAR JOHN
3701 Going to find a bare-foot brother out
3702 One of our order, to associate me,
3703 Here in this city visiting the sick,
3704 And finding him, the searchers of the town,
3705 Suspecting that we both were in a house
3706 Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
3707 Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
3708 So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
3709 FRIAR LAURENCE
3710 Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
3711 FRIAR JOHN
3712 I could not send it,--here it is again,--
3713 Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
3714 So fearful were they of infection.
3715 FRIAR LAURENCE
3716 Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
3717 The letter was not nice but full of charge
3718 Of dear import, and the neglecting it
3719 May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
3720 Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
3721 Unto my cell.
3722 FRIAR JOHN
3723 Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
3724 Exit
3725 FRIAR LAURENCE
3726 Now must I to the monument alone;
3727 Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
3728 She will beshrew me much that Romeo
3729 Hath had no notice of these accidents;
3730 But I will write again to Mantua,
3731 And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
3732 Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
3733 Exit
3734 SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.
3735 Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch
3736 PARIS
3737 Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
3738 Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
3739 Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
3740 Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
3741 So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
3742 Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
3743 But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
3744 As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
3745 Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
3746 PAGE
3747 [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
3748 Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
3749 Retires
3750 PARIS
3751 Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
3752 O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
3753 Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
3754 Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
3755 The obsequies that I for thee will keep
3756 Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
3757 The Page whistles
3758 The boy gives warning something doth approach.
3759 What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
3760 To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
3761 What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
3762 Retires
3763 Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c
3764 ROMEO
3765 Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
3766 Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
3767 See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
3768 Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
3769 Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
3770 And do not interrupt me in my course.
3771 Why I descend into this bed of death,
3772 Is partly to behold my lady's face;
3773 But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
3774 A precious ring, a ring that I must use
3775 In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
3776 But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
3777 In what I further shall intend to do,
3778 By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
3779 And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
3780 The time and my intents are savage-wild,
3781 More fierce and more inexorable far
3782 Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
3783 BALTHASAR
3784 I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
3785 ROMEO
3786 So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
3787 Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
3788 BALTHASAR
3789 [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
3790 His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
3791 Retires
3792 ROMEO
3793 Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
3794 Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
3795 Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
3796 And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
3797 Opens the tomb
3798 PARIS
3799 This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
3800 That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
3801 It is supposed, the fair creature died;
3802 And here is come to do some villanous shame
3803 To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
3804 Comes forward
3805 Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
3806 Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
3807 Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
3808 Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
3809 ROMEO
3810 I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
3811 Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
3812 Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
3813 Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
3814 Put not another sin upon my head,
3815 By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
3816 By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
3817 For I come hither arm'd against myself:
3818 Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
3819 A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
3820 PARIS
3821 I do defy thy conjurations,
3822 And apprehend thee for a felon here.
3823 ROMEO
3824 Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
3825 They fight
3826 PAGE
3827 O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
3828 Exit
3829 PARIS
3830 O, I am slain!
3831 Falls
3832 If thou be merciful,
3833 Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
3834 Dies
3835 ROMEO
3836 In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
3837 Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
3838 What said my man, when my betossed soul
3839 Did not attend him as we rode? I think
3840 He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
3841 Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
3842 Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
3843 To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
3844 One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
3845 I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
3846 A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
3847 For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
3848 This vault a feasting presence full of light.
3849 Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
3850 Laying PARIS in the tomb
3851 How oft when men are at the point of death
3852 Have they been merry! which their keepers call
3853 A lightning before death: O, how may I
3854 Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
3855 Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
3856 Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
3857 Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
3858 Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
3859 And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
3860 Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
3861 O, what more favour can I do to thee,
3862 Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
3863 To sunder his that was thine enemy?
3864 Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
3865 Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
3866 That unsubstantial death is amorous,
3867 And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
3868 Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
3869 For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
3870 And never from this palace of dim night
3871 Depart again: here, here will I remain
3872 With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
3873 Will I set up my everlasting rest,
3874 And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
3875 From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
3876 Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
3877 The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
3878 A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
3879 Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
3880 Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
3881 The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
3882 Here's to my love!
3883 Drinks
3884 O true apothecary!
3885 Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
3886 Dies
3887 Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade
3888 FRIAR LAURENCE
3889 Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
3890 Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
3891 BALTHASAR
3892 Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
3893 FRIAR LAURENCE
3894 Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
3895 What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
3896 To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
3897 It burneth in the Capel's monument.
3898 BALTHASAR
3899 It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
3900 One that you love.
3901 FRIAR LAURENCE
3902 Who is it?
3903 BALTHASAR
3904 Romeo.
3905 FRIAR LAURENCE
3906 How long hath he been there?
3907 BALTHASAR
3908 Full half an hour.
3909 FRIAR LAURENCE
3910 Go with me to the vault.
3911 BALTHASAR
3912 I dare not, sir
3913 My master knows not but I am gone hence;
3914 And fearfully did menace me with death,
3915 If I did stay to look on his intents.
3916 FRIAR LAURENCE
3917 Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
3918 O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
3919 BALTHASAR
3920 As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
3921 I dreamt my master and another fought,
3922 And that my master slew him.
3923 FRIAR LAURENCE
3924 Romeo!
3925 Advances
3926 Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
3927 The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
3928 What mean these masterless and gory swords
3929 To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
3930 Enters the tomb
3931 Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
3932 And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
3933 Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
3934 The lady stirs.
3935 JULIET wakes
3936 JULIET
3937 O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
3938 I do remember well where I should be,
3939 And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
3940 Noise within
3941 FRIAR LAURENCE
3942 I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
3943 Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
3944 A greater power than we can contradict
3945 Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
3946 Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
3947 And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
3948 Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
3949 Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
3950 Come, go, good Juliet,
3951 Noise again
3952 I dare no longer stay.
3953 JULIET
3954 Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
3955 Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
3956 What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
3957 Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
3958 O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
3959 To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
3960 Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
3961 To make die with a restorative.
3962 Kisses him
3963 Thy lips are warm.
3964 First Watchman
3965 [Within] Lead, boy: which way?
3966 JULIET
3967 Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
3968 Snatching ROMEO's dagger
3969 This is thy sheath;
3970 Stabs herself
3971 there rust, and let me die.
3972 Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies
3973 Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS
3974 PAGE
3975 This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
3976 First Watchman
3977 The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
3978 Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
3979 Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
3980 And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
3981 Who here hath lain these two days buried.
3982 Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
3983 Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
3984 We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
3985 But the true ground of all these piteous woes
3986 We cannot without circumstance descry.
3987 Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR
3988 Second Watchman
3989 Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
3990 First Watchman
3991 Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
3992 Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE
3993 Third Watchman
3994 Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
3995 We took this mattock and this spade from him,
3996 As he was coming from this churchyard side.
3997 First Watchman
3998 A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
3999 Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
4000 PRINCE
4001 What misadventure is so early up,
4002 That calls our person from our morning's rest?
4003 Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others
4004 CAPULET
4005 What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
4006 LADY CAPULET
4007 The people in the street cry Romeo,
4008 Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
4009 With open outcry toward our monument.
4010 PRINCE
4011 What fear is this which startles in our ears?
4012 First Watchman
4013 Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
4014 And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
4015 Warm and new kill'd.
4016 PRINCE
4017 Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
4018 First Watchman
4019 Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
4020 With instruments upon them, fit to open
4021 These dead men's tombs.
4022 CAPULET
4023 O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
4024 This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
4025 Is empty on the back of Montague,--
4026 And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
4027 LADY CAPULET
4028 O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
4029 That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
4030 Enter MONTAGUE and others
4031 PRINCE
4032 Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
4033 To see thy son and heir more early down.
4034 MONTAGUE
4035 Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
4036 Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
4037 What further woe conspires against mine age?
4038 PRINCE
4039 Look, and thou shalt see.
4040 MONTAGUE
4041 O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
4042 To press before thy father to a grave?
4043 PRINCE
4044 Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
4045 Till we can clear these ambiguities,
4046 And know their spring, their head, their
4047 true descent;
4048 And then will I be general of your woes,
4049 And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
4050 And let mischance be slave to patience.
4051 Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
4052 FRIAR LAURENCE
4053 I am the greatest, able to do least,
4054 Yet most suspected, as the time and place
4055 Doth make against me of this direful murder;
4056 And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
4057 Myself condemned and myself excused.
4058 PRINCE
4059 Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
4060 FRIAR LAURENCE
4061 I will be brief, for my short date of breath
4062 Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
4063 Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
4064 And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
4065 I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
4066 Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
4067 Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
4068 For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
4069 You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
4070 Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
4071 To County Paris: then comes she to me,
4072 And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
4073 To rid her from this second marriage,
4074 Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
4075 Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
4076 A sleeping potion; which so took effect
4077 As I intended, for it wrought on her
4078 The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
4079 That he should hither come as this dire night,
4080 To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
4081 Being the time the potion's force should cease.
4082 But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
4083 Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
4084 Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
4085 At the prefixed hour of her waking,
4086 Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
4087 Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
4088 Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
4089 But when I came, some minute ere the time
4090 Of her awaking, here untimely lay
4091 The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
4092 She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
4093 And bear this work of heaven with patience:
4094 But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
4095 And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
4096 But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
4097 All this I know; and to the marriage
4098 Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
4099 Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
4100 Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
4101 Unto the rigour of severest law.
4102 PRINCE
4103 We still have known thee for a holy man.
4104 Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
4105 BALTHASAR
4106 I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
4107 And then in post he came from Mantua
4108 To this same place, to this same monument.
4109 This letter he early bid me give his father,
4110 And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
4111 I departed not and left him there.
4112 PRINCE
4113 Give me the letter; I will look on it.
4114 Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
4115 Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
4116 PAGE
4117 He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
4118 And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
4119 Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
4120 And by and by my master drew on him;
4121 And then I ran away to call the watch.
4122 PRINCE
4123 This letter doth make good the friar's words,
4124 Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
4125 And here he writes that he did buy a poison
4126 Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
4127 Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
4128 Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
4129 See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
4130 That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
4131 And I for winking at your discords too
4132 Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
4133 CAPULET
4134 O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
4135 This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
4136 Can I demand.
4137 MONTAGUE
4138 But I can give thee more:
4139 For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
4140 That while Verona by that name is known,
4141 There shall no figure at such rate be set
4142 As that of true and faithful Juliet.
4143 CAPULET
4144 As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
4145 Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
4146 PRINCE
4147 A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
4148 The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
4149 Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
4150 Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
4151 For never was a story of more woe
4152 Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
4153 Exeunt
